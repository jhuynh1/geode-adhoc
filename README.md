# geode-adhoc

Clunky test code

Modify GemFireTest and ClientPutter as needed (paths etc)

StandUpLocatorAndServers - attempts to start up locator and however many servers (not configurable at the moment, just copy and paste more servers as needed)

StopLocatorsAndServers - attempts to stop specific locator and servers

ClientPutter - puts entries into /region using the defined objects
